.. _datalad-next:

What's next in DataLad?
-----------------------

The `datalad-next extension <http://docs.datalad.org/projects/next/en/latest/index.html>`_ is a noteworthy extension not only because of the additional functionality it provides, but also because of its role in the development process of the datalad core package.
It can be thought of as a staging area for additional functionality, or for improved performance and user experience.
New features are introduced into ``datalad-next`` first, and, once tested for a sufficient amount of time and deemed useful, adopted in the core datalad package.
As such, ``datalad-next`` isn't confined to a topical set of features, but provides functionality with broad applicability.
Some of this functionality takes the form of new stand-alone commands, while other functionality concerns improvements of existing commands under the hood via a special patch mechanism or modern reimplementations of established concepts.

As development in this extension is dynamic, the best place to find and up-to-date overview of functionality is in its `source repository <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-next#summary-of-functionality-provided-by-this-extension>`_.
